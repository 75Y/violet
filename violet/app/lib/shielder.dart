// Pornography is illegal in South Korea.
// Also, in accordance with the Child and Youth Protection Act, 
// just watching a cartoon with a 2d character can get the same punishment 
// as having a child pornography if it is a character related to a child.
// The law was created a long time ago and the amendment came into effect on June 2, 2020. 
// The amendments became stronger, and controls and regulations became tighter.
// It sounds like a ridiculous word, but in Korea, it is all true.
// 
// Action for Koreans
// 1. Filtering related tags.
// 2. Do not caching images
// 3. Delegating responsibility to users
//
// I am not a Korean, and I do not have a Korean nationality and 
// I live in a country not subject to Korean Law.
