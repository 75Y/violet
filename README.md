Project Violet Source Code

## Development

If you want to contribute to this project, please leave an issue or pull request.

### Front-end

#### Script based Service

`Violet` runs the script on the client. 
The reason for using the script is to make frequent updates unnecessary and apply changes in real time. 
Script execution is protected by elliptic curve-based asymmetric encryption.

### Back-end

I use lightcell, s3, elastic-cache, rds, cloudflare and docker.

#### Source code of backend

Source code of violet is not provided in general. 
Please contact me if you are interested.

## Value of this

It provides a very fast and safe service environment. 
By constructing a new virtual environment by blocking and reconfiguring all incomplete advertisements, 
clients can be safe from attacks from adware or other source sites. 
You can also use the concurrent access proxy tcp to quickly download data and show high response rates.

## Profit model

The violet project does not make money. 
This is because the data collected from the backend is simply secondary processed and provided, 
and some acts violate the terms of the Play Store and App Store.
The project can grow if you contribute to the server fee.
